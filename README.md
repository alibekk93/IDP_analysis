# Mesophiles vs. Thermophiles: Untangling the Hot Mess of In-trinsically Disordered Proteins and Growth Temperature of Bacteria

**Abstract**

The dynamic structures and varying functions of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) have made them fascinating subjects in molecular biology. Investigating IDP abundance in different bacterial species is crucial for understanding adaptive strategies in diverse environments. Nota-bly, thermophilic bacteria have lower IDP abundance than mesophiles, and a negative correlation with optimal growth temperature (OGT) has been observed. However, the factors driving these trends are yet to be fully understood.

We examine the types of IDPs present in both mesophiles and thermophiles, alongside those unique to just mesophiles. The shared group of IDPs exhibit similar disorder levels in the two groups of species, suggesting that certain IDPs unique to mesophiles may contribute to the ob-served decrease in IDP abundance as OGT increases. Subsequently, we used quasi-independent contrasts to explore the relationship between OGT and IDP abundance evolution. Interestingly, we find no significant relationship between OGT and IDP abundance contrasts, suggesting that the evolution of lower IDP abundance in thermophiles may not be solely linked to OGT.

This study provides a foundation for future research into the intricate relationship between IDP evolution and environmental adaptation. Our findings support further research on the adaptive significance of intrinsic disorder in bacterial species.
