Intrinsically disordered proteins in thermophilic bacteria

**Abstract**

The study of IDP is growing in importance as intrinsic disorder is being associated with more and more diverse functions. While IDP are present in all domains of life, their abundance varies depending on a number of factors, including genome size, GC content and organism complexity. In prokaryotes, one of these factors is optimal growth temperature, however it is not apparent how exactly temperature affects IDP abundance â€“ on the one hand disorder had been associated with adaptations to temperature changes, on the other hand there are studies that observe a positive correlation between higher optimal growth temperature and lower IDP abundance. In this study we computed disorder levels for entire proteomes of *T. thermophilus*, the most well-studied thermophilic bacteria, and *E. coli*, a mesophile. We found that *T. thermophilus* has a significantly higher IDP abundance. Moreover, using a novel method of comparing orthologous IDP, we show how specific regions where disorder is higher or lower can be identified for orthologous proteins. Finally, we found that while *T. thermophilus* has a higher IDP abundance, the disordered proteins themselves are often uncharacterized. This highlights the need to further study IDP in thermophile bacteria.
